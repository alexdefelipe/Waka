# Waka

Waka (provisional name) is a project whose main aim is to bring to not programming-knowledged researchers a tool with which produce machine learning models. With it, researchers will be able to train several models with different parameters and they will also be able to vary the their database without modifying their files. After every trainning session, a report of the model performance will be generated. In addition, Waka will store the information of every session and will let a certain researcher recover it at any moment.

**Disclaimer: this project is for skills practice purpose only**
